    "In 2017 I gave a talk called \"Tricks for cleaning your data in R\" which I presented at the [Data+Narrative workshop](http://www.bu.edu/com/data-narrative/) at Boston University. The repo with the code and data, https://github.com/underthecurve/r-data-cleaning-tricks, was pretty well-received, so I figured I'd try to do some of the same stuff in Python using `pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer:** when it comes to data stuff, I'm much better with R, especially the `tidyverse` set of packages, than with Python, but in my last job I used Python's `pandas` library to do a lot of data processing since Python was the dominant language there.\n",

    "Anyway, here goes: \n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning is a cumbersome task, and it can be hard to navigate in programming languages like Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `pandas` library in Python is a powerful tool for data cleaning and analysis. By default, it leaves a trail of code that documents all the work you've done, which makes it extremely useful for creating reproducible workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, I'll show you some examples of real-life \"messy\" datasets, the problems they present for analysis in Python's `pandas` library, and some of the solutions to these problems.\n",
